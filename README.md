# AmortPlanCalculator
Simple bond amortization calculator

You probably have to change the connection string in appsettings

I don't think you actually need the dapper package (visual studio extension).

Regarding code:
-calculates interest from the second month on
-i wrote the code in slovenian language (apologize for this, future projects will be all in english)
-written in winforms (c#)
